## Quickstart

```rust
use eor::prelude::*;
```

## Overview

### Design Philosophy

Dreg started out as a fork of the [`ratatui`] crate (the successor to [`tui-rs`]) after I realized how bloated it had become.

The design of Dreg has been radical simplicity from the very start.

## Acknowledgments

- [`ratatui`] & [`tui-rs`], for the original inspiration for the project.
